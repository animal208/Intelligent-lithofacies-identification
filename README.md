Intelligent electrofacies classification and lithofacies identification based on machine learning algorithms
An integrated approach for intelligent electrofacies classification and lithofacies identification.Intelligent machine learning methods, including t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm, unsupervised spectral clustering analysis, and support vector machine are used to establish a data-driven lithofacies prediction model of the target formation.
